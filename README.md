# WhatsApp Business API
In this project, I have used the third party WhatsApp Business Service Provider (BSP) Twilio (sandbox API) to access the WhatsApp Business API and created a web server hosted on Heroku at https://internshipbot1007.herokuapp.com/ which has been added to the Twilio console as an endpoint to send a post request whenever a message is received by Twilio.

This project has been built using python with flask and integrated with Google Dialogflow (to generate responses for your messages).

## Try it Out

 - Open WhatsApp and send the message 'join pile-situation' ( a code to get access to our project ) to the number +14155238886 ( Twilio Sandbox Bot Number ).
 - Now whenever you send a message to the number, it will give u a response based on your message by referring to Google's Small Talk Dialogflow.
